D. Baggage Claim
time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes
Every airport has a baggage claim area, and Balbesovo Airport is no exception. At some point, one of the administrators at Sheremetyevo came up with an unusual idea: to change the traditional shape of the baggage claim conveyor from a carousel to a more complex form.

Suppose that the baggage claim area is represented as a rectangular grid of size n×m
. The administration proposed that the path of the conveyor should pass through the cells p1,p2,…,p2k+1
, where pi=(xi,yi)
.

For each cell pi
 and the next cell pi+1
 (where 1≤i≤2k
), these cells must share a common side. Additionally, the path must be simple, meaning that for no pair of indices i≠j
 should the cells pi
 and pj
 coincide.

Unfortunately, the route plan was accidentally spoiled by spilled coffee, and only the cells with odd indices of the path were preserved: p1,p3,p5,…,p2k+1
. Your task is to determine the number of ways to restore the original complete path p1,p2,…,p2k+1
 given these k+1
 cells.

Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo 109+7
.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤3⋅104
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n
, m
, and k
 (1≤n,m≤1000
, n⋅m≥3
, 1≤k≤⌊12(nm−1)⌋
) — the dimensions of the grid and a parameter defining the length of the path.

Next, there are k+1
 lines, the i
-th of which contains two integers x2i−1
 and y2i−1
 (1≤x2i−1≤n
, 1≤y2i−1≤m
) — the coordinates of the cell p2i−1
 that lies on the path.

It is guaranteed that all pairs (x2i−1,y2i−1)
 are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum n⋅m
 over all test cases does not exceed 106
.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of ways to restore the original complete path modulo 109+7
.

Note
In the first test case, there are two possible paths:

(1,1)→(2,1)→(2,2)→(2,3)→(2,4)
(1,1)→(1,2)→(2,2)→(2,3)→(2,4)
In the second test case, there is no suitable path, as the cells (1,1)
 and (1,4)
 do not have a common neighboring cell.
